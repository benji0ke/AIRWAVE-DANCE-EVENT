Airwave Dance site

This site is created as a school project to best help and understand Web Development.

How it works

When a user enters [https://benji0ke.github.io/Airwave-Dance-Event/](https://benji0ke.github.io/Airwave-Dance-Event/) in a browser,
the browser breaks the URL into parts — scheme (`https`), hostname (`benji0ke.github.io`), and path (`/Airwave-Dance-Event`). 
It then asks the DNS resolver for the server’s IP address. The resolver follows the DNS chain (root → TLD → authoritative) until it finds the correct IP and sends it back.


The site consists of a Homepage which has links to different pages like about, schedule, registration, judges and contact information.
